# RealisticDensity Mod for Cities Skylines II

Have you always been annoyed that you have to build such large industrial areas? Or that your business takes up almost as much space as your residential areas?
Why a power plant only has 10 employees or a high school with 2000 students only employs a handful of teachers?
